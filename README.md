# psx_autumn2001 QoL map patcher
This is a simple Lua script that improves the experience you'll have on **psx_autumn2001** that is available on the Garry's Mod Workshop.
The script is all coded in one file (that's only ~320 lines!) and loaded automatically by the server.</br></br>
This script is not guaranteed to maintain a working status as the Workshop map is constantly updated. If the script breaks, either wait for me to update it or do it yourself (if you have the knowledge.)

## Installation
1. Download the *master.zip* file.
2. Open the *.zip* file you downloaded and copy/extract the *lua* folder into your `<steamapps>/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod` directory.
3. Launch Garry's Mod.
4. Select **psx_autumn2001** from the map list (and make sure it's downloaded!)
